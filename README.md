This sample application demonstrates how to extract properties from elements and generate a project dashboard. Also shows a nested view with 2d views of the model (if available).

This sample is based on the Learn Forge tutorials in the section *View BIM 360 models* and *Dashboard*. The original implementation was based on [Jim Awe - LMVNavTest](https://github.com/JimAwe/LmvNavTest) (Depracated).

# Setup

## Prerequisites

1. **BIM 360 Account**: must be Account Admin to add the app integration. [Learn about provisioning](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps).
2. **Forge Account**: Learn how to create a Forge Account, activate subscription and create an app at [this tutorial](http://learnforge.autodesk.io/#/account/). 
3. **Visual Code** or any other text-based tool.
4. **JavaScript** basic knowledge with **jQuery**.
5. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

### Run locally

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

Clone this project or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    git clone https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge-bim360reports

To run it, install the required packages, set the enviroment variables with your client ID & secret and finally start it. Via command line, navigate to the folder where this repository was cloned and use the following:

Mac OSX/Linux (Terminal)

    npm install
    export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM FORGE DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR FORGE CLIENT SECRET>>
    export FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=<<YOUR CALLBACK URL FROM FORGE DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    npm run dev

Windows (use <b>Node.js command line</b> from Start menu)

    npm install
    set FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM FORGE DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    set FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR FORGE CLIENT SECRET>>
    set FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=<<YOUR CALLBACK URL FROM FORGE DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    npm run dev

Open the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Important:** do not use **npm start** locally, this is intended for PRODUCTION only with HTTPS (SSL) secure cookies.

## Deployment

To deploy this application to Heroku, the **Callback URL** for Forge must use your `.herokuapp.com` address. After clicking on the button below, at the Heroku Create New App page, set your Client ID, Secret and Callback URL for Forge.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqa9O20Gj0c) on how deploy samples to Heroku.


## Packages used

All Autodesk Forge NPM packages are included by default, see complete list of what's available at [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/autodesk). OAuth, Model Derivative and OSS are used. Some other non-Autodesk packaged are used, including [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and its session/cookie middlewares ([express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and [cookie-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser)) for user session handling. The front-end uses [bootsrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) and [jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery).

## Tips & tricks

For local development/testing, consider use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package, which auto restart your node application after any modification on your code. To install it, use:

    sudo npm install -g nodemon

Then, instead of <b>npm run dev</b>, use the following:

    npm run nodemon

Which executes **nodemon server.js --ignore www/**, where the **--ignore** parameter indicates that the app should not restart if files under **www** folder are modified.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Cannot see my BIM 360 projects**: Make sure to provision the Forge App Client ID within the BIM 360 Account, [learn more here](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps). This requires the Account Admin permission.

2. **error setting certificate verify locations** error: may happen on Windows, use the following: `git config --global http.sslverify "false"`
